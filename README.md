## Motivation 🚀

Here we go! I took some time today after work to craft something interesting to let you work on and learn and then discuss the work and the possible implementations. 

## The rules ⚠️

1. I managed to capture the output and I want you to reproduce it pixel-perfect or should I say **animation-perfect** lol The only condition: use only pure css with `@keyframes`
2. I created the following repository so you can push you code properly
3. You have to first create a different branch called `develop` where each different part of your code shall be commited.
4. After creating a Pull Request against the `main` branch, create a second branch from `develop` called `squashed-dev` and squash all your commits to only one.

Good Luck! See you at the PR review! 😉
